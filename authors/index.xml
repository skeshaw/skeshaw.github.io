      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working in the algorithms team of Adobe AdCloud Search (prev. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adobe.com/advertising/media-optimizer.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adobe Media Optimizer&lt;/a&gt;), where I build models which manage ad spends for businesses. I graduated from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iitk.ac.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IIT Kanpur&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2017, with a major in Mathematics and Scientific Computing and a minor in Artificial Intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;
My research interests include neural text generation tasks, which include neural machine translation (NMT) and abstractive summarization. I have worked on a variety of projects in machine learning, including summarization, object detection, and Bayesian matrix factorization. I have also worked on transfer learning, both in machine translation and in reinforcement learning.&lt;br /&gt;
Football occupies my weekends, and I also like to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ea.com/games/fifa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
